# VPC

VPC is a secure, private and isolated area in the cloud to run applications and store data.

A VPC allows you to create a virtual network in th cloud, allowing us to have a private section of the internet. It allows you to create and manage Google Cloud resources.

Similar to a physical network, VPCs have their configurations and rules, allowing resource organization and control on how services communicate.

Gatewyays or routers can be set up to connect VPCs to the internet as other networks, making the exit points for inbound and outbound traffic. Traffic flow and security measures can be implemented to protect resources from unauthorized access.

Like all other cloud providers, GCP provides you with a default VPC as soon as you created an account and a project. That leaves us to create VPCs for our projects
