## Introduction to Google Compute Engine (GCE):

What is GCE and why is it important?

'''

- Google Compute Engine (GCE) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- It hosts Linux and Windows machines and provides secure computing for activation that can scale within minutes.

- Cost and performance optimization is done with commitments, spot instances and other methods mentioned in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) documentation.

'''

GCE usecases

'''

- Secure, reliable, high-performance and cost effective computing for complex business and application needs.

- Dynamic capacity scaling, GCP's pay-as-you-go pricing benefits and accessing environments in minutes.

- Delivering a broad choice of computing, networking and storage services that optimizes price performance for projects.

GCE Instance Types

You can follow [this page](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource)! for detailed and up-to-date information.

General Purpose

'''

General purpose delivers computing, storage and memory instances in a balanced way and they are good for test and production environments for softwares, small databases, web servers and many other applications that doesn't have a specific need.

'''

Compute Optimized

'''

Compute optimized instances provide much higher ratio of computing power over memory. They are good in workloads that require high-performance. Machine learning, data engineering, high-performance applications and servers are some of the most relevant use cases for this instance.

'''

Memory optimized

'''

They are used to handle memory-instensive workloads. They are suitable for in-memory data stores, simulation and high performance databases.

'''

Accelerator optimized
'''

They are used to handle high performance computing workloads in Google Cloud. They are suitable for GPU-enabled ML model training, HPC, parallel computing and many more use cases.

How to launch GCE instance?

1 - Go to your Google Cloud account and then click on Google Console

2 - Then, click to navigation menu, choose compute engine and choose VM instances. During this step, never forget to enable Google Compute API.

3 - Click create instances
