# Google Cloud Functions

### What are Google Cloud Functions?

Google Cloud Functions provides serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With simple, single-purpose functions through the SDK, you can utilize them for your cloud infrastructure by executing your code in fully managed environment. It supports Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP and .NET Core and it can scale automatically without worrying about your infrastructure and your functions are automatically managed and scaled depending on your requirements.

###Â What are events and triggers?

Events are defined as things happening in a certain cloud environment such as changes in storage system or modifications to your cloud infrastructure. They occur regardless of your choice of response and they can be created by triggers.

Triggers are declarations that interests the concerned party in various events. They can be binded on functions to act and capture on events.

### How Cloud Functions are useful for cloud infrastructure?

It provides a connective layer to your infrastructure by letting you write code to connect and extend the scale of services. In addition to its initial role, they listen and respond to changes in cloud resources. Also, they're integrated with Google Cloud services and authenticated with Google Service Account credentials.

### Use cases

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: By utilizing cloud functions for computer vision, LLM (Large Language Models) and other analytical tasks concerning with computing, analysis, virtual assistants, providing analytics, sentiment analysis for faster and more efficient insights.

**Serverless backend**: Whether it's mobile or web based applications, you can use back ends such as Appwrite and Firebase for mobile and web applications. They can handle upcoming requests and execute corresponding functions, keep users engaged and offload your computing resource requirements to Google Cloud.

**Webhooks**: HTTP triggers can be used to respond to 3rd party systems to authenticate users, create accounts, add accounts and provide a more diverse group of services.

**APIs**: APIs can be developed and deployed by using Cloud Functions for mobile, desktop and web applications and you can integrate your 3rd party applications with your applications.
