# gcp-for-blockchain-and-devops

A detailed course of GCP services for DevOps.

This course aims to teach you important Google Cloud services for DevOps with both theoretical knowledge and with applications. This repo will include examples, use cases, projects and real-time interview questions. Each module will allow you to apply what you've learned and gain practical skills for DevOps with Google Cloud

## Modules

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

You will explore IAM, which is used for managing access to GCP resources. You'll learn how to create IAM users, groups, and roles, and how to apply permissions and security best practices to ensure proper access control.

### Compute Engine

You will explore Google Compute Engine, which provides virtual servers and computing resources. It provides safe, reliable and scalable infrastructure and costs can be managed with rightsizing, autoscaling, preemptive VMs, commitments and automating cost optimization.

**Projects** : Creating a Hello World Website on Apache, Configure Internal Load Balancing

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

This section includes Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Google Cloud Platform. Here, you'll learn what is VPC, how to configure a VPC, subnet, route table, enabling to design and maintain VPC infrastructure.

### Cloud DNS

This section includes an in-depth explanation of Cloud DNS, Google's Domain Name System.

### Cloud Storage

You will explore Cloud Storage, Google Cloud's primary storage solution. Here, you'll learn about Cloud Storage, creating buckets, uploading objects to buckets and downloading objects from buckets. 

### gcloud CLI

You will explore gcloud CLI, Google Cloud CLI for computers. Here, you'll learn about the gcloud CLI, basic commands and how to install the CLI on your computer. 

How to install and use gcloud CLI?

### Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM)

This section involves how to deploy Google Cloud resources using Cloud Deployment Manager (CDM).

**Background Information**: Google CDM is used as an infrastructure deployment service for Google Cloud resources. Here, you can use templates to create your own resources and deploy them using `gcloud`.

You can learn more about CDM by using the Google Cloud documentation.

### Cloud Source Repositories

This section focuses on Cloud Source Repositories, a managed source control service provided by Google Cloud. This section teaches you how to set up a Git repository in Cloud Source Repositories, collaborate with team members and managing versions.

### Cloud Build

### Cloud Functions

Here, you will learn about Google Cloud Functions, whom they provide a serverless approach for applications.

### Artifact Registry

Google Cloud has container registry known as Artifact Registry, which is same with Azure Container Registry or Amazon ECR. In this section, we will learn different ways of repositories and how to create them.

### Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Here, you will learn about world's managed Kubernetes solution, Google Kubernetes Engine. You will learn about installing gkectl, GKE's managed Kubernetes solution and we will do two real-time demos to further solidify our understanding of Google Kubernetes Engine.

### Load Balancing

Here, you will learn how to use Load Balancing with Google Cloud, which is an integral component of production servers deployed to Google Cloud.

### Cloud Monitoring

### Cloud Run
